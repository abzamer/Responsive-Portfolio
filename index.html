            <p>
            I was born and raised in the wonderfully diverse city of Houston, Texas. College took me to Austin, Texas where I
            graduated from the University of Texas at Austin.
            </p>
            <p>
            I have been a Dual Language elementary teacher for the past 8 years for Round Rock ISD. This means that instruction
            in my classroom was done the following way for my first graders: 80% in Spanish and 20% in English. Everyone says
            that the magic happens when you see students ‘get it’. I disagree. It’s the struggle, questions, attempts,
            collaboration, and peer encouragement that truly brought me joy. It was my responsibility to not only teach two
            languages but to create learners that could advocate for themselves, even at a young age.
            </p>
            <p>
            My career in education brought me to another realization: I am ready to learn a new language(s) and to push myself
            out of my comfort zone.
            </p>
            <p>
            Currently, I live in Austin, Texas with my husband, Kamal and our two children, César and Camila. We enjoy
            experiencing the world from their eyes.
